The sd card that was already written for pi worked but the new samsung sd card (not formatted) would not work.

The original image for 13.2.0 OLPC Sugar was tough to come by.

Examination of the packages leads me to believe that:

1. Totem with Gstreamer works with FFMPEG.

Images will be uploaded too - screen captures relevant.
H264 was working.

From the installed software file, it looks like VLC, Gstreamer, FFMPEg and Totem are installed.

Nice to Have -  a list of packages in a clean install and to know video did not work in the clean install.

Custom Sugar ISO from your olpc image


Goal: Find out what software was existing.
Not easy without a clean install..

Obviously, the software installed is totem and gstreamer.
See images.
