Overview: Almost 300,000 OLPC units need to be able to play mp4.
The enginnering students did not know what they did in order to get video working on the 1.75
They were mechanical, not computer - 
After I showed the .bash_history file to one mechanical engineer, I was pretty sure they could go back and figure it out

That being said, the 1.75 model is ARM architecture with better processing and more RAM.
They gave me a 1.0. That task was similar and different.

The Task was 
#Update OLPC 8.2 to play Mp4
  Research included - discovery of kernel version
  Need: mplayer version for 8.2 - is this 9.1 RH? 2008 ish?
  redhat-release overwritten
  no OS-release
  lsb_release not installed

Another thing I did
#script for Raspbian - Solar Spell
  Generate a script based on their commands and instructions
  Some done
  Find out more about internationalisation and commands for SolarSpell Raspi-config
  
What's next
#nextSteps
  vbox for olpc if possible
  more research
  VideoLAN? ffmpeg? 
  
One step closer...
